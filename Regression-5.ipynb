    "Q1. What is Elastic Net Regression and How Does It Differ from Other Regression Techniques?\n",
    "Elastic Net Regression:\n",
    "•\tConcept: Elastic Net Regression combines the penalties of both Ridge Regression (L2 regularization) and Lasso Regression (L1 regularization). The loss function for Elastic Net Regression is: Loss=MSE+λ1∑j=1p∣βj∣+λ2∑j=1pβj2\\text{Loss} = \\text{MSE} + \\lambda_1 \\sum_{j=1}^p |\\beta_j| + \\lambda_2 \\sum_{j=1}^p \\beta_j^2Loss=MSE+λ1∑j=1p∣βj∣+λ2∑j=1pβj2\n",
    "o\tλ1 (lambda1): Regularization parameter for the L1 penalty (Lasso).\n",
    "o\tλ2 (lambda2): Regularization parameter for the L2 penalty (Ridge).\n",
    "Differences from Other Techniques:\n",
    "•\tCombination of Penalties: Elastic Net Regression leverages both L1 and L2 penalties, allowing it to handle feature selection (like Lasso) and coefficient shrinkage (like Ridge).\n",
    "•\tHandling Multicollinearity: It is more effective than Lasso when dealing with highly correlated features because it retains some coefficients while still performing regularization.\n",
    "•\tFeature Selection and Shrinkage: Elastic Net provides a balance between feature selection and coefficient shrinkage, making it a versatile choice.\n",
    "Q2. How Do You Choose the Optimal Values of the Regularization Parameters for Elastic Net Regression?\n",
    "•\tCross-Validation: Use k-fold cross-validation to evaluate different values for λ1 and λ2. This helps find the combination of parameters that minimizes the cross-validation error.\n",
    "•\tGrid Search: Perform a grid search over a range of λ1 and λ2 values to find the optimal parameters.\n",
    "•\tRandom Search: Randomly sample values for λ1 and λ2 to find effective parameters, which can be more efficient than a grid search.\n",
    "Q3. Advantages and Disadvantages of Elastic Net Regression\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "•\tCombines Strengths: Utilizes both L1 and L2 regularization, which helps in feature selection and reduces model complexity.\n",
    "•\tHandles Multicollinearity: More robust in the presence of multicollinearity compared to Lasso.\n",
    "•\tFlexibility: Allows for a balance between Lasso and Ridge, adjusting the degree of regularization.\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "•\tComplexity: Involves tuning two hyperparameters (λ1 and λ2), which can complicate the model selection process.\n",
    "•\tOverhead: More computationally intensive compared to simple Ridge or Lasso regression.\n",
    "Q4. Common Use Cases for Elastic Net Regression\n",
    "•\tHigh-Dimensional Data: Effective in scenarios where the number of features is large relative to the number of observations.\n",
    "•\tMulticollinearity: Useful when features are highly correlated, as it can handle the collinearity better than Lasso alone.\n",
    "•\tFeature Selection and Regularization: Ideal for problems where both feature selection and regularization are required.\n",
    "Q5. How Do You Interpret the Coefficients in Elastic Net Regression?\n",
    "•\tCoefficients Interpretation: In Elastic Net, coefficients are influenced by both L1 and L2 penalties. Coefficients that are non-zero represent the features that are selected and have an impact on the response variable. The magnitude of the coefficients indicates the strength of the relationship between the features and the target. However, interpretation should consider that some coefficients may be shrunken due to regularization.\n",
    "Q6. How Do You Handle Missing Values When Using Elastic Net Regression?\n",
    "•\tImputation: Use techniques such as mean, median, or mode imputation to fill in missing values. More advanced methods include using algorithms like k-nearest neighbors or iterative imputation.\n",
    "•\tRemoval: Remove rows with missing values if the number of such rows is small compared to the dataset size.\n",
    "•\tFeature Engineering: Create additional features that indicate the presence of missing values if appropriate.\n",
    "Q7. How Do You Use Elastic Net Regression for Feature Selection?\n",
    "•\tFeature Selection: Elastic Net performs feature selection by shrinking some coefficients to zero (L1 penalty) while keeping others. This effectively eliminates irrelevant features. By adjusting the regularization parameters (λ1 and λ2), you can control the degree of sparsity and selection.\n",
    "Q8. How Do You Pickle and Unpickle a Trained Elastic Net Regression Model in Python?\n",
    "Pickling:\n",
    "import pickle\n",
    "from sklearn.linear_model import ElasticNet\n",
    "\n",
    "# Assuming `model` is your trained Elastic Net model\n",
    "with open('elastic_net_model.pkl', 'wb') as file:\n",
    "    pickle.dump(model, file)\n",
    "Unpickling:\n",
    "\n",
    "import pickle\n",
    "\n",
    "with open('elastic_net_model.pkl', 'rb') as file:\n",
    "    model = pickle.load(file)\n",
    "Q9. What Is the Purpose of Pickling a Model in Machine Learning?\n",
    "•\tPersistence: Pickling allows you to save a trained model to a file so that you can load and use it later without retraining. This is useful for deploying models into production or sharing them with others.\n",
    "•\tEfficiency: Reduces the need to retrain models every time you need to use them, saving computational resources and time.\n",
